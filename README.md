# PixelHyperCube's website

This repo stores all of my codes for my personal website - [pixelhypercube.github.io](https://pixelhypercube.github.io) .

This website is a portfolio about who I am, my hobbies and the programming projects that I've done (something like a resume).

Feel free to breeze through my website!

Thanks a lot for stopping by!

*P.S. I'm not much of a writer so it'll be nice if you can forgive me if my sentences written on my website are a bit weird haha ðŸ˜‚*
