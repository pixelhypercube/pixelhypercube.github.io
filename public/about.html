                            <p>I'm currently a 3rd year student studying in Singapore Polytechnic for a Diploma in Information Technology! As of now, I'm currently interning at Leaptron Engineering Pte. Ltd. as a software engineer. My areas of interests revolve around the areas of technology, especially computers!</p>
                            <p>I'm a generally curious person that wants to know more about the things I'm interested in, as I like to crave new knowledge. For instance, I have a habit of going deeper into a topic that I come across and know many of its facts. </p>

                        <div class="col-md-6">
                            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated with computers, where I would typically spend a few hours on them daily! When I was 10, I discovered <a class="text-dark" href="./minecraft.html">Minecraft</a>, where it would instantly be my all-time favorite game just after a while of playing it!</p>
                            <p>Since I really enjoyed playing the game so much, I began to investigate the mechanics of the game. Because of that, I became more skilled in using computer functions, such as file management. Thanks to Minecraft, my passion for technology has grown tremendously!</p>

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>During my free time, I like to play videogames (and you guessed it! Minecraft!), reading online articles (e.g. Wikipedia) and learning a Japanese! (よろしくお願いいたします！) </p>
                    <p>When I'm away from my keyboard (AFK), I like to do distance running to stabilize my mental health and reduce stress! Apart from that, I would sometimes hang out with my friends (when COVID rules are easened) so that I could catch up with them!</p>
                    <h2>What I strive in life</h2>
                    <p>I strive to take my physical and mental health seriously as those are one of my major factors of living a fulfilling life! I try to take my life to the fullest as life is short, so I want to experience life in its full color!</p>
                    <!-- <p>I'm Kai Jie and I'm currently a student studying in Singapore Polytechnic's School of Computing for a Diploma in Information Technology.</p>
                    <p>I have a passion for IT and I'm curious to learn more about the plethora of different areas in IT, which include Full Stack Development, Mobile Application Develpment, etc.</p>
                    <p>During my primary school days, my interest in computers began when I was introduced to programs like Cinema 4D and games like Minecraft. As I gained exposure from them, I got to learn more about how to use computer functions, such as file management.</p>
                    <p>After finishing secondary School, I initially self-learned programming and web development via SoloLearn before moving onto Polytechnic for my further studies.</p>
                    <p>I think Minecraft and Cinema 4D made me instill my passion into programming as without them, I wouldn't know where I would be today.</p> -->
