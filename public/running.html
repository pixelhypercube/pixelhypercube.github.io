                        <p style="font-size:16px;">Thanks for your understanding! ;)</p>

                    <h1><u>Why I run</u></h1>
                    <p>Even though running may seem boring just by using only your 2 legs to move, I feel that it adds a lot of positives to it.</p>
                    <p>It helps me to manage my stress levels and it sets myself new challenges to tackle with, such as finishing 15 km of running in a single day.</p>
                    <h3>How I came back to running:</h3>
                    <p>Before coming back to running, I didn't have much of a positive mood as compared to now. Exercise wasn't much of a thing to me, and I wasn't conscious of its benefits.</p>
                    <p>Even though I was in a fitness club when I was a kid, I haven't developed the interest in running yet. However, it gave me a number of opportunities for me to exercise.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the workout options on my Apple Watch (and Strava), it helps me manage and track my workouts, especially for running. It also gets me more motivated to exercise!</p>

                            <p>I wanted to do something special during the day after my birthday - so I decided to do 1 km for 1 year I've lived.</p>
                            <p>Again, another exhausting run during the later portions where I was literally 'steaming' when I stopped at the 12.5km mark! Because of that, I walked for a while when I was in need for air.</p>
                            <p>But I tried my best and finished the 18 km!</p>
                            <p>Overall, another great experience!</p>
