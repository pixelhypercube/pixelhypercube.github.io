                    <p>As someone who used to face numerous communication difficulties in my youth, it was a huge challenge to navigate through complex social interactions with my peers. Growing up in primary and secondary school, my conversational skills were relatively impaired, which was likely caused by being a late talker at age 4, and the fact that my brain is a little bit different from others <i>(neurodivergent gang lesgoo!)</i>.</p>
                    <p>As a result, I severely lacked the skills required for me to have a smooth conversation with my peers without prompting, coupled with noticeable language delays. Because of these hardships, I have indeed went through numerous painful journeys of misunderstandings, which have ultimately shaped the way I am today. With that, here are some tips I used to improve my conversational journey since the start of my Polytechnic education.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>1. Join Orientations! üéä</h4>
                    <p>Orientation is one of the best opportunities to not only introduce yourself and meet new people, but also to enjoy fun activities and bond with your peers (if all goes to plan!). However, this did not come easy for me as firstly, I was a very reticent person who typically shy away from most things. On top of that, I faced numerous anxiety attacks because I was not used to meeting so many new people all at once.</p>
                    <p>Despite my internal mental battles, it has eventually helped me to build strong interpersonal connections with my peers in my orientation groups, as we were mostly grouped together in the same class. I am extremely thankful to the camaraderie and understanding of my classmates, who were patient and supportive of my needs.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I get to meet a wide spectrum of students all across many different backgrounds all across Singapore. If you are going through a tough time during orientation, always remind yourself: you&rsquo;ve already done something brave by stepping out of your comfort zone &mdash; and that&rsquo;s a big win!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>2. Ask someone you really trust for suggestions on communicating in difficult situations üòä</h4>
                    <p>I know this might sound a little bit kiddish, but having someone who can guide you with your conversational skills is essentially crucial, especially because Polytechnic is known for its rigorous group-work assignments.</p>
                    <p>When I was faced with difficulties with working in group projects, I asked my parents for advice on how to communicate better with my groupmates, and it did help out to a certain extent. At first, it felt like trial and error, but with practice and persistence, I gradually learned how to communicate more effectively in team settings.</p>
                    <p>Over time, I managed to communicate effectively with my peers, and I was able to fulfil most of the assignments' requirements, and in a many cases, exceeding them. This led me to getting in maintaining my cumulative GPA of at least 3.9/4 for the first 4 semesters and I am extremely grateful to the teamwork and support of my group members who understood my limitations and accepted me as a functioning groupmate.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>3. If possible, share your unique story about your own challenges with your classmates in a module! üó£Ô∏è</h4>
                    <p>This might sound like a challenge as this is quite a step out of your comfort zone, but I'll tell you, it's worth it to a certain extent. I was very blessed and fortunate to have an interdisciplinary communication module (modules that every student across all disciplines in Polytechnic has to fulfil) that allows us to share our unique struggles and challenges we face on our day-to-day lives.</p>
                    <p>For one of the assignments, we had to give a presentation that allowed us to share our life experiences. Naturally, I chose to talk about my daily struggles with communication and social interaction. At first, I was nervous, unsure of how my classmates would respond. But when I finished, I was met with a thunderous round of applause. To top it off, I received a 'Distinction' grade for the module!</p>
                    <p>What made it even more meaningful was that I had been with this same group of classmates for nearly two years. After I shared my story, they became more understanding and empathetic toward the challenges I faced. It helped build stronger bonds and created a more supportive environment, not just for me but for others who might have their own invisible struggles too.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>Final Thoughts üí≠</h4>
                    <p>My journey in Polytechnic has been far from easy, especially as someone who started with less-than-ideal conversational skills. But by stepping out of my comfort zone, seeking advice from trusted people, and sharing my story with honesty, I managed to turn these challenges into growth opportunities.</p>
                    <p>If you're like me - shy, anxious, or feeling a bit lost in complex social situations - remember: every small step counts. Progress may feel slow at times, but with persistence and the right support, you'll find your voice in your own time.</p>
                    <p>Keep going. you got this. :) üí™</p>

                <p>I have been running long distances as a hobby for about 6 years, but my progress plateaued - my pace stayed roughly the same over the years, and my heart rate remained relatively high. However, things have changed when I stepped outside my comfort zone to join my hall's Road Relay CCA, despite not knowing anyone in my hall before this (as I didn't join my hall's orientation due to National Service commitments üò©).</p>
                <p>I was hoping there would be a running CCA. And there was no surprise that they did, when one of the members approached me and asked if I was interested in running. As a person who typically does long-distance runs (‚â•5 km per run), I was open to their training regimen, which focused on speed workouts and interval training, usually covering middle-distance ranges (~3‚Äì5 km). I didn't hesitate - I gladly decided to sign up.</p>
                <p>Despite not having a lot of prior experience with training for running, I was surprisingly competent enough to keep up with their training regimen. As their training mainly consisted of time trials, fartleks (alternating between fast and slow intervals) and interval training, it was undoubtedly not easy for me to feel at ease during my runs. It was nothing like how I felt during my typical long runs - usually calm with strong hints of exhaustion üò™. Every time I suffered during the process, the stronger I became, and surprisingly, I felt a rush of dopamine right after finishing my last set of fast runs. Even though I was busy adjusting to university life, making time for training kept me grounded and motivated. Additionally, I totally didn't expect to break several personal bests during their training - 9:06 for 2.4 km and 21:12 for 5 km! üéâ</p>
                <p>To my surprise, I was one of the few people selected to take part in this year's Inter-Hall Olympiad Games for Road Relay, which felt like a huge milestone in my running journey. Being part of the team not only pushed me to improve physically but also gave me a sense of belonging in my hall community. I'm excited to continue this journey and see where it takes me next!</p>
                <p>As the competition was held late in the morning, the weather was much worse than ideal - the sun was glaring down on the track, and the temperature felt blazing. Despite this, I was determined to try my best to represent my hall proudly. However, I felt a wave of anxiousness sweep inside of me as it was my very first time in my life that I was representing my school in some way. As a result, I felt like my performance felt short of my expectations - I clocked 10:30 for 2.5 km (I was hoping to run under 10 minutes), because the sun was strong enough to penetrate through my shoes!</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, I'm deeply grateful that my team managed to secure 1st Runner-Up, which is also the very first time my hall has received a medal for Road Relay! ü•à</p>

                <p>Looking back, I felt like joining a running CCA was one of the best decisions I made to improve my running stamina. I was surrounded by people who shared similar experiences and were willing to endure the hardships of training along together. The fact that I was surrounded with like-minded people not only made the journey more enjoyable but also pushed me to reach new heights. Therefore, I highly recommend stepping outside your comfort zone and joining a club that motivates you to become better at something you're passionate about! üí™</p>

            <h4>Early Days:</h4>
            <p>Ever since I was young, I have usually kept to myself as I was mainly glued to my interests that didn't involve a lot of interaction with people - mainly computer games (especially Minecraft) and other tech-related stuff. Because of that, I often felt that something was inherently wrong with me for not being willing to communicate with others, resulting in me feeling rather alienated. At the same time, I was labelled as a person who was extremely quiet, rarely talking to others without prompting.</p>
            <h4>Finding My Fellow Introverts:</h4>
            <p>But that all changed during my Polytechnic days, where we all had to do an MBTI test in one class, which revealed that most of my classmates leaned towards the introverted side as well, as they did not appear to be as talkative as my classmates back in secondary school. For the first time, I felt like I had found people who belong to the same 'species' as I do, and I felt like I could relate to a lot of them more. However, the environment I experienced during my Polytechnic days helped me step outside my comfort zone from simply being labelled as an 'extreme' introvert, despite the total lockdown during COVID times. Due to COVID, I had to work on group projects purely on Microsoft Teams, where I had to do a certain degree of interaction, but I wasn't the most confident in doing so. Thankfully, everything has gone much better than I expected, and I even did quite well in those modules.</p>
            <h4>The Challenges of Stepping Outside My Comfort Zone:</h4>
            <p>It was definitely not an easy journey to open up myself as a shy, reticent, and introverted person. During my NS days, I faced a lot of difficulties opening up and communicating with others, as it was my very first time working in a predominantly office setting as an Administrative Support Assistant (ASA) in a HQ unit. Initially, when I first got posted to my unit, I was a soft-spoken person who didn't talk very much with others. However, when I started to familiarize myself with my others better, my voice started to get quite loud (sometimes too loud - apologies! üôè), which might make it seem like I'm more extroverted. But the truth is, my body starts to feel relatively drained after a whole day of socializing with others, even though I admit I like to socialize and chat at times. Additionally, due to my not-so-ideal mental state at the time, it made my days even more exhausting at timesü•≤. But thankfully, I have experienced a lot of fun moments I had with my other mates while serving, and additionally, the gifts I received from my superiors included notes that appreciated me for &quot;making the office lively&quot; - even if I was occasionally too loud (again, sorry! üôè).</p>
            <h4>How Introverted Brains Are Wired:</h4>
            <p>Every time I socialize with others, my brain tires out like a depleting battery - for instance, 3 hours of non-stop socializing drains my brain battery by about 50%, and more than that will then exponentially deplete to 0%. As a result, I need to &quot;charge back&quot; my battery to 100%, allowing me to fully energize myself after that moment. That is generally how introverted brains work - you lose energy when you socialize and recharge when you're by yourself. In contrast, truly extroverted brains recharge through interacting with others and feel drained when they're alone - it's just a different kind of wiring.</p>
            <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
            <p>At the end of the day, being an introvert is perfectly fine - it's simply how the brain is wired. We introverts can be amazing at socializing with others because we humans are social creatures who thrive on social interactions. So, we should know when to recharge our batteries if things tend to get overwhelming. Thus, given the right scenario, we should also learn how to interact properly with others and appear confident and active in discussions!</p>

                <h4>What is Kanji?</h4>

                <p>Kanji (Êº¢Â≠ó) are logographic characters used in the Japanese writing system, originally borrowed from Chinese. Unlike the Latin alphabet or even Japanese syllabic scripts like Hiragana („Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™/Âπ≥‰ªÆÂêç) and Katakana („Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä/Áâá‰ªÆÂêç), each Kanji character represents a word or concept and often has multiple pronunciations depending on context. Kanji is one of the three writing systems used in modern Japanese‚Äîthe others being Hiragana and Katakana‚Äîand it's essential for reading books, signs, newspapers, and even names.</p>

                <p>For learners of Japanese, Kanji can be one of the most fascinating yet frustrating hurdles to overcome. Why? That's what I'll explore in this post.</p>

                <h4>My Journey with Kanji</h4>
                <p>As a person who self-learns Japanese on and off, I have undoubtedly faced numerous difficulties adapting to the complexities of Kanji. When I first started learning Kanji, it felt like I was re-learning Chinese again, with entirely new pronunciations of the characters, and to no surprise, it took me a long time to adjust to the way that Kanji is pronounced. Additionally, reading Kanji felt like a chore in the beginning as I don't use Chinese frequently, which includes reading and writing Chinese characters.</p>

                <p>The main reason Kanji can be astronomically difficult to learn is the number of readings each character can have. Most Kanji are typically divided into 2 classes of pronunciation: On'yomi (Èü≥Ë™≠„Åø) - derived from Middle Chinese pronunciation, and Kun'yomi (Ë®ìË™≠„Åø) - the native Japanese pronunciation.</p>

                <p>As someone who occasionally speaks Teochew, a Chinese dialect, to my grandma at home, I was surprised to discover that some Sino-Japanese vocabulary have quite similar pronunciations to Teochew.</p>

                <p>Because of these similarities, it became relatively easier for me to guess the pronunciation of each Kanji's On'yomi (Èü≥Ë™≠„Åø) pronunciation. Whereas, as Kun'yomi (Ë®ìË™≠„Åø) is the native, indigenous Japanese pronunciation of Kanji, their pronunciations are mostly totally unrelated to On'yomi (Èü≥Ë™≠„Åø), where the pronunciations are purely an import from the sounds of Middle Chinese characters. As a result, I am noticeably weaker in terms of memorizing Kun'yomi (Ë®ìË™≠„Åø), and I would not be able to guess each character correctly at first glance.</p>

                <h4>Overcoming the Challenges</h4>
                <p>Despite all these challenges, there are quite a lot of fun and intuitive approaches to combat the anxiousness of not knowing the correct pronunciation for each Kanji. For instance, I have been playing Nintendo DS games that have helped me improve my kanji reading and writing skills! However, since the games are entirely in Japanese, I have largely missed one big portion - knowing the meaning of each vocab. Despite knowing a wider variety of Kanji to pronounce correctly, I still feel like I don't fully understand its true meaning.</p>

                <h5>Some games that practice Kanji skills (but all in Japanese)</h5>
                <div className="d-flex">
                    <div className="row">
                        <figure className="col-lg-5 col-12">

                        </figure>
                        <figure className="col-lg-7 col-12">
                            <img className="mb-1" style={{maxWidth:"min(500px,90vw)"}} src="/assets/img/blogs/kanjiTyping.gif" alt="kanjiTyping.gif"/>
                            <figcaption style={{fontSize:"16px"}}>Gameplay of <i>Kanji De GO! (Êº¢Â≠ó„ÅßGO!)</i></figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Additionally, listening to songs (with Japanese and English lyrics), as well as singing them (despite not being a great singer at all HAHAHA), have also helped me quite a big deal, as I get to know the context behind the word being used in such songs.</p>

                <h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
                <p>I hope I don't scare you about the complexities of Kanji. But despite these challenges, there are numerous benefits to Kanji. For example, it allows to "simplify" words that might otherwise be written in long strings of unrecognizable Hiragana, especially in personal names. Without Kanji, understanding the meaning of certain words in purely Hiragana/Katakana would be much more challenging.</p>

                <p>So, my advice to you is to always take baby steps by learning a few Kanji at first and slowly progressing once you become familiar with them. It's understandable if you feel like giving up, as I've felt the same way when learning other languages. Knowing Chinese can also be a good head start, but however, do take note that the way Japanese Kanji is being written right now largely resembles Traditional Chinese, but with many simplified characters that are sometimes different from Simplified Chinese characters.</p>

                <p>
                    As someone who has never touched a math question for 2 years because of my National Service (NS) obligations, I initially found it challenging to get back into solving mathematical problems during my first semester in university. On top of that, math at university is on a whole different level ‚Äî it involves more than just learning how to solve equations and finding the right answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I ventured into mathematical modules like discrete maths and linear algebra, there is a ton of proving involved, and knowing the steps to prove them is quite a daunting task for me, even for relatively basic mathematical equations. However, I have found a cure that would assist me in making sure I grasp the concepts with ease. With that said, here are some of my top tips I used to combat the difficulties I was facing when solving mathematical problems!
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 1: Practice, practice... and more practice!</h3>
                <p>
                    This is undoubtedly one of the best ways to not only understand how to just solve mathematical equations, but also making sure that you are familiar with understanding the theoretical concepts behind those problems. The focus shouldn't be just on the final answer, but on the methods and thought processes that lead you there. If you are initially unsure about a problem, you can refer to the steps and methodologies used to solve the problem (you can use Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, but at your own risk! üò∂). If you are only hooked onto the final answer, you likely won't know how to arrive at the answer, because your best tools for solving problems are the steps and methods, not just the final answer. Even though I was not the fastest to keep up with the rigor, the hard work paid off eventually!
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 2: Come up with flashcards, especially for tests and exams!</h3>
                <p>
                    Flashcards are a powerful tool for spaced repetition, and they really helped me recall key concepts during finals! I designed my flashcards to reinforce key concepts, formulas, and exam tricks taken from past year exam papers. For instance, while I was preparing for my discrete maths finals, I came up with cards that contain useful supplementary information, formulas and methods in addition to the main concepts used in the whole module (<a href="https://pixelhypercube.github.io/ntu/#/FileViewer/files/MH1812/MH1812.csv">Check out my flashcards here!</a>). I focused my flashcards on weak points and overlooked details, which helped me strengthen gaps in my understanding before finals. By the time finals came, I felt much more confident‚Äîthough I still fumbled on a few questions!
                </p>

                <h3>Tip 3: Write down more notes and 'engage' with them!</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite having an average typing speed of around 100-120 words per minute, the effects of writing notes significantly boosts my memory retention. This is because most of the time, we spend more time writing than typing while performing mathematical operations, and that writing is relatively easier than simply typing out mathematical formulas and equations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, learning how to 'engage' while writing notes is extremely beneficial instead of blindly copying and pasting information. What I meant by 'engaging' is the fact that you are actively using the mathematical concepts you're already trying to grasp into your own notes independently, where for instance, you are able to come up with more definitive examples in certain mathematical problems, as well as applying the steps in greater detail.

                    <p>
                        As someone who scrolls Reddit from time to time, I found this subreddit to be surprisingly hilarious and useful at the same time as I get to see math being used in a humorous way. Discovering this subreddit made me realize that mathematics can be used in a funny and joking way, and my perception of maths is less of being a chore of brainlessly solving problems without any sort of humor around it. In a way, the humor and the impressive visualizations of the posts help me picture maths better, as these posts mostly provide useful examples to mathematical concepts, which will yet, also be extremely useful in tests and exams!

                <p>During my secondary school days, I discovered Duolingo, a widely popular language learning app, because I had a dream of becoming multilingual one day. I remember being incredibly proud when I could say and write simple phrases in Japanese, such as "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ„ÄÅ„ÅäÂÖÉÊ∞ó„Åß„Åô„ÅãÔºü" after just a few lessons. However, as time passed, my enthusiasm evolved into a love-hate relationship with <i>Duo</i>, the green owl. Despite periods of intense use, I started taking long breaks, unsure whether it was truly helping me improve my language skills as a casual language learner.</p>

                <h4>Gamification Aspects</h4>
                <p>One of the main features that stands out from many other language learning apps is the heavy use of gamification, which includes XP, health bars, gems, and, of course, streaks. At first, I thought this was sort of a fun idea for me to get hooked on language learning. However, there were times when I felt that I was relatively distracted by it, especially the weekly leaderboards and the pressure of maintaining a streak. As a result, these major distractions defeat the primary purpose of learning new languages, the core goal of language learning apps. Additionally, I find Duolingo's streak tracker to be somewhat annoying at times, as it sends reminders constantly.</p>

                <h4>Shallow Learning Behind Convenient Design</h4>
                <p>There is no doubt that Duolingo's word bank drag-and-drop functionality to form sentences quickly has been very helpful and efficient. However, since these errors occur frequently across exercises, many users complete exercises mindlessly, without thinking through accurate translations. This again significantly defeats the purpose of accurately forming sentences, and it doesn't give a perfect scenario of forming the sentences with minimal external guidance, as you are not guided by tools that help you form sentences in real life. However, if you want to practice further using a keyboard while typing out sentences, it'll be much more beneficial as it will help you hone your language skills much faster (but at your own risk - you might easily lose out on lives if you get them wrong!)</p>
                <p>Another drawback I've noticed is the quality of Duolingo's audio, especially for certain languages. Some of the voice recordings sound unnatural and have accents that don't fully reflect native pronunciation, which may confuse learners trying to develop proper speaking and listening skills.</p>

                <h4>Easy to Get Motivated for Beginners</h4>
                <p>When I first started using Duolingo, it felt quite enjoyable because I got my first taste of what learning a new language is like. The addition of gamification to the app made it more enjoyable, especially for first-time users. It was a great first introduction to new languages, and I felt proud to form simple sentences early on.</p>

                <h4>But Not Enough for Intermediate Learners</h4>
                <p>However, as I ventured deeper into the language, I felt that there were many better opportunities to learn it in a unique and fun way, as Duolingo's repetitive and competitive gamified system can start to feel limiting. In my opinion, if you already understand the basic structure of the language(s) you're currently learning, there are more fun ways to boost your language skills, by actively watching videos & movies, listening to music, and reading simple articles & books in your target language. If you feel that your level of understanding is not optimal, you can enable subtitles in your native language or use a translator to comprehend the content thoroughly. Additionally, browser extensions that help further boost language learning skills can be beneficial too ‚Äî try extensions like <a href="https://www.languagereactor.com/">Language Reactor</a>!</p>

                <h4>How I use Duolingo Today</h4>
                <p>Eventually, I stopped relying on Duolingo as my primary learning tool. Now, I use it more as a supplementary activity to review vocabulary, get daily exposure, or stay consistent on lazy days. For more serious progress, I turn to other resources, such as using flashcards (like Anki), specialised language learning games/apps, and eventually practising talking to native speakers in your target language. It's all about finding the right balance. Duolingo, like every other app, is not perfect ‚Äî it has its perks, but it is also riddled with its flaws.</p>

                <h4>Would I Recommend Duolingo?</h4>
                <p>I think Duolingo is a great app for absolute beginners with little to no proficiency in the target language. It is also quite convenient ‚Äî you can simply open the app to learn or review in a relatively short amount of time, especially when you are busy with other commitments. For that reason, it offers an excellent introduction to a new language. The gamified atmosphere makes it more engaging for users to get hooked on the learning process and start building basic sentence skills for daily use.</p>

                <p>However, once you transition to an intermediate or advanced level of proficiency, Duolingo starts to reveal its limitations. It relies heavily on repetitive sentence structures and guided aids, and it doesn't do a great job of teaching more complex grammar or cultural nuances.</p>

                <h4>Beyond Duolingo</h4>
                <p>If you already have a grasp of the fundamentals, it's worth branching out ‚Äî watch videos or movies in your target language, listen to music, chat with native speakers, or even play games by switching the language settings to the language you're learning. And don't be afraid to use subtitles or translation tools while you build confidence.</p>

                <p>In the end, real language learning takes more than daily streaks ‚Äî it takes curiosity, commitment, and the courage to step outside the app. Though I've moved beyond Duolingo, it was the first step toward fulfilling my dream of becoming multilingual ‚Äî and for that, I'll always be grateful to <i>Duo</i>.</p>

                <p>Growing up, I have constantly felt different from others, which sometimes made me feel that I was an alien trapped in a human body. In my youth, I felt quite atypical as I had very different interests compared to most people my age, as well as feeling quite socially awkward at times. But now, at the age of 23 (by the time I was writing this blog), I have almost fully integrated into society but with a few refinements still in progress. Now, let me introduce my own profile about how my neurological compass looks like.</p>
                <h5>My Compass Profile üß≠</h5>
                <p>Firstly, I am neurodivergent, which simply means that my brain is wired in a way different from the norm. Just before I turned 15 (Secondary 3), I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder), mainly because my brain struggled with proper social interaction. Additionally, having unique and restricted interests that are very different from the majority made life feel like playing on hard mode, because I could not find anyone to vibe with. </p>

                    <figure className="col-lg-6 col-md-12">
                        <img style={{maxWidth:"300px"}} alt="speedcubing" src="/assets/img/blogs/speedcubing.gif"/>
                        <figcaption style={{fontSize:"14px"}}>Sub-10 seconds 3x3 Rubik's Cube Solve</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </div>
                <p>One of those special interests included experimenting with Minecraft with advanced functionalities, such as the use of command blocks and speed-solving Rubik's Cubes. I had even made numerous YouTube videos about these at the time, which showed that I was deeply passionate about my hobbies. </p>
                
                <p>It is also interesting to note that I had recently learned that I was intellectually gifted during my ASD screening at the time, as one section required me to take an IQ test. My official results revealed that my core abstract reasoning and analytical abilities were very high, putting me into the intellectually gifted category. However, this potential existed alongside the significant challenges of my neurodivergence, defining me as Twice Exceptional (2e).</p>
                
                <p>This explains why I was genuinely interested in hobbies that involved tinkering with Minecraft and using my spatial recognition abilities by speed solving Rubik&#039;s Cubes, interests shared by only a small minority of my peers.</p>
                
                <p>Even though I constantly strived to gain genuine friendships back in secondary school, I still failed miserably because of my social communication difficulties that were tied in with my ASD. Additionally, being intellectually gifted introduced me to another set of challenges, mainly because my interests do not vibe well with what most people are interested in. Because of this, I did not have the best school experience as I constantly felt isolated from my peers even though my peers did not mean to do any harm to me. Right after completing my IGCSEs (equivalent to GCE O-Levels in Singapore), I had decided to make the switch to studying in Singapore Polytechnic to pursue the things I've been passionate about since I was a kid ‚Äî computers. üñ•Ô∏è</p>
                <h5>My Polytechnic Days üéí</h5>
                <p>Working on group projects in Polytechnic required strong communication skills, which I initially struggled with heavily. This led to some misunderstandings between my groupmates and me, mainly because I did not know the best way to communicate with them. Thankfully, they were quite understanding, and they have let me contribute meaningfully to all the group projects! As a result, I managed to level up my social communication skills, which greatly helped me to function in life much better. But one of my big turning points was when I got enlisted into National Service (NS).</p>
                
                <h5>New Discoveries in NS ü™ñ</h5>
                <p>After a couple of months into service, I was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD (ADHD-PI), as I had a hard time managing tasks and staying focused. I would face numerous difficulties in doing job tasks as my mind would unconsciously drift and jump around often. However, it is important to note that this form of ADHD is not hyperactive, as I never had major issues in situations that required me to sit still.</p>
                
                <p>Growing up in a sheltered environment, I found it tough to break out of my shell. Adjusting to office life was slow ‚Äî after all, this was my first real job, working as an Admin Support Assistant (a.k.a. clerk). This took a toll on my mental health, and I went through depressive episodes from feeling undervalued &amp; underappreciated, as well as going through many of my insecurities. Even though I was considered fortunate to be placed in a relatively comfortable position to serve NS, it was not all easy as there were numerous challenges I had to deal with in the office. I felt like my mental state and motivation to learn had been knocked into a deep hole. Climbing back out was exceptionally hard. But that all changed when I started to disrupt from NS to kickstart my full-time university studies.</p>
                
                <h5>Kickstarting my University Life üè´</h5>
                <p>Right after matriculating into university, I was concerned that my passion for Computer Science had dwindled due to my less-than-ideal mental state at the time when I was serving NS. Surprisingly, my mental health has slowly managed to get better over time, while simultaneously becoming increasingly passionate about learning Computer Science. As a result, I successfully regained my interest in the field, and I started practicing and learning how to solve LeetCode problems and successfully deploying several of my own programming projects üîß! Upon learning about my diagnosis, I developed numerous coping mechanisms to manage my symptoms, as knowing my weaknesses tied to my diagnosis has helped me tremendously in dealing with my day-to-day functions.</p>
                
                <h5>Back to NS (Again) ü™ñ</h5>
                <p>However, since I had not yet finished serving NS at the time, I constantly had the fear of returning to camp, due to what I experienced before I disrupted. After finishing my last exam in NTU, I immediately resumed my NS the next day, where I was posted back to the same unit, but in a different camp. Luckily, my post-resumption NS life has been smooth, as my new superiors would not only recognize my abilities and the work I&#039;ve done in NS, but could also engage in my banter! In the end, I was quite lucky as I felt that my differences were understood and that my mental health was quite stable and healthy during that period. üòä</p>
                
                <h5>Still Navigating the Compass üó∫Ô∏èüß≠</h5>
                <p>Looking back, I've made progress I never imagined possible with my neurological compass. Despite the ups and downs of serving NS in an office environment, I was quite fortunate to take the opportunity to learn and hone new useful and important life skills that are easily transferable in the future. I was grateful and lucky to do programming during NS ‚Äî something I never imagined possible in a military environment!</p>
                
                <p>I've made progress I never imagined possible with my neurological compass. Looking back, I'm genuinely proud of how much I've accomplished and the challenges I've overcome. Even though the world isn't always friendly to people like me, I constantly strive to do my best. It is already 2025, and with greater understanding and access to learning about neurodivergent individuals, it&#039;s time that we should all learn about leveraging their strengths and how beneficial we can allow them to thrive well not only in the corporate world, but life in general.</p>
                
                <p>In the end, it is really ok if you feel you don't fit within neurological norms (and I mean that in a non-evil way!). Everyone has their own quirks ‚Äî some people are tall, some people are short, some have big feet, some small. So, don&#039;t beat yourself up about the fact that you feel different, but instead learn how to embrace our differences, which is what I am still learning to this day! Being different isn&#039;t a weakness ‚Äî it&#039;s a unique strength. I&#039;m still learning to embrace my own differences, and I hope this inspires others to do the same. üí™</p>
